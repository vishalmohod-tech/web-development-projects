# web-development-projects
"I consistently explore and build web development projects from scratch as part of my journey to becoming a Full Stack Developer. Each project strengthens my frontend skills in HTML and CSS while preparing for JavaScript, backend, and full-stack development. Letâ€™s build, learn, and grow together."
